Derivatives Pricing Documentation
=================================

Derivatives Prticing is a library implementing mathematical models for derivatives pricing. Its core components are:
- **instruments**: This module holds all derivative instrument implementations (i.e. forwards, options, swaps, ...)
- **models**: This module holds all model implementations (i.e. Black-Scholes, Heston, ...)
- **processes**: This module holds all stochastic process implementations (i.e. Brownian Motion, Geometric Brownian Motion, ...)
